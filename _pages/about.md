This page presents the publications and tools developed by a group of researchers, engineers and PhD students originally from [MIA Paris-Saclay](https://mia-pas.inrae.fr) and [MaIAGE](https://maiage-pas.inrae.fr), around multivariate Poisson lognormal models (_a.k.a_ "PLN" models) and their application to life sciences. We also highlight the research projects associated with these developments, and the collaborations generated by the distribution of our tools. This page also lists the various resources (documentation, journal articles, git repositories, training courses, etc.) associated with PLN-team
